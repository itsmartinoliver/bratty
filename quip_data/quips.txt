I know this is your way of telling me I was wrong and I don't find it very funny. Maybe you won't find it funny anymore now that I let everyone se what you're doing. I'm not afraid of you anymore and I have nothing left to lose.

Me and LeBum were in class the other day when the teacher paired us up as partners for a book report. Everything was going fine until LeFraud asked me which book we should choose to do our report on and I suggested the Lord of the Rings. Out of nowhere LeCrybaby burst out into TEARS in front of the whole class! The teacher came over to console him and sent me to Principal Adam Silver’s office as punishment. How was I supposed to know that LeMickey was scared of that book because he could never win a real ring himself?
Went costume shopping for Halloween with my son and I pointed at a Mickey Mouse outfit and I asked him, son would you want this costume? He said "no daddy I don’t want to be LeFraud for Halloween, not at least until he wins a real ring" I shed tears of joy.
I was at Toys r Us with my 2 year old son shopping for Mickey Mouse toys when suddenly one of them started moving! To my shock it was LeMickey! My son said "dad is it true that LeFraud has no real rings" I said "yes son, and he will never win a real ring". LeBooty ran away crying
RIDICULOUS!     I was watching the Mickey Mouse Ceremony on Disney Channel with my 7 year old son and guess who shows up On the screen?     LeFraud himself!       My son asked me "is that the man who choked 6x in the finals and can’t win a real ring"        I had to lie to my own son. Shame on LeBum

Western European type that combines features of Nordid and Mediterranid in a unique way. Resembles British Iron Age Celts. The principal element in Ireland and parts of Britain, especially Western Scotland and Wales. Common in Northwestern France, sometimes Belgium, Switzerland, Liguria, Western Germany, and Norway. Sporadically from Portugal and Galicia to Austria and Sweden. Not to be confused with British Eurafricanids altered by Nordid admixture.
The most typical Pamirid variety, also called Mountain Pamirid. Often considered the most typical Turanid. Most common in highland Tajiks, who not only live in Tajikistan, but also Northern Afghanistan and Eastern Uzbekistan. Shows intermediate features between the Plains Pamirid and East Pamirid. It was originally more widespread, and has been pushed back by the Tungid expansion. Sometimes in Uzbeks, Uyghurs, and other Turkic people.

In literature, mythology, and comic books many heros often have a "kryptonite" or "achilles heel", basically a weakness that makes them vulerable. I'm curios what fans here would consider to be Supermans "kryptonite"?

In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, or equivalently, a decrease in the frequency, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency and energy, is known as a blueshift.

The Mini P.E.K.K.A card is unlocked from the Training Camp (Tutorial). He is a single-target, melee troop with moderate hitpoints and very high damage. He is clothed in gray metal armor and wields a smaller version of the P.E.K.K.A's sword. His horns are a bright vivid team color, along with his single eye. A Mini P.E.K.K.A card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.Strategy. Like the Prince, he is best used defensively against single troops and then for a counterattack due to his slow attack speed but very high damage. He can be used with high hitpoint troops, such as the Giant or Golem, so that they tank all of the damage dealt by opposing units while the Mini P.E.K.K.A deals massive damage to them. However, this strategy is very vulnerable to swarm cards, so it should be used cautiously. A Mini P.E.K.K.A can defeat equally leveled Musketeers, Wizards, Electro Wizards, Ice Wizards, and Magic Archers in one hit for a similar Elixir cost, making him useful for quickly taking out these troops behind a tank.Most grounded units, even Skeletons, placed at a distance are capable of eliminating a Mini P.E.K.K.A with the help of a Princess Tower.Area damage units and spells complement the Mini P.E.K.K.A and its synergies well since its slow hitspeed is ineffective versus swarms. Slower and tankier area damage units like a Valkyrie should be placed in front of the Mini P.E.K.K.A so it can push them forward more quickly, while they tank for the Mini P.E.K.K.A faster and more fragile area damage units like the Fire Spirit should be placed behind it so it can protect them.Due to the many positive Elixir trades that can be made on a Mini P.E.K.K.A, it is generally not effective to send one down the lane by itself, as this usually results in a waste of four Elixir. However, if the opponent happens to be low on Elixir or lacks a cheap counter, then this strategy is capable of dealing major damage to the opponent's tower or can force a bad trade. The Player should never ignore a M

tutors are bad because, imagine you're tutroing for a card, right? and when you go through your library, you look at all the cards. you're not supposed to do that, but with the tutor. with the totor you go through your deck and get a card. i mean its fine if you get a land because, well. you need the lands to play your spells. everyone knows this. but you tutor and say you get a card that isnt a land (which is bad) so you go. you go and get the card and when you play it, sometimes you play it, sometimes it goes into your had. when it goes on top of the library its like ok, its on the top of the library, but you draw a card each turn so it goes into your hand. so when so when you tutor for the card, there are lost of cards in the deck, and one of the cards lets you look for the rest. thats one card of the one hundred cards getting you a one undred card, so thats two hundred card that you seasrching the deck for because which is too much. so when my friend kevin, he plays the land commander, he plays card and tutors for land, bnut my friend ethan he plays the red commander that goes so hes red and cant tutor but. sometimes there is black or sometimes blue and they can tutor. so when you tutor you get the two cards of a hundresd cards and you choose. which is more than draw because the card goes into your hand if you choose. so tutors are bed because the tutor goes into your hand after you cast the spell. commander shouldnt be like that. you ruing the fun and i think you should listen to other people more. just because you are youtube does not mean you are right. everyone thinks you are wrongd
