I know this is your way of telling me I was wrong and I don't find it very funny. Maybe you won't find it funny anymore now that I let everyone se what you're doing. I'm not afraid of you anymore and I have nothing left to lose.

Me and LeBum were in class the other day when the teacher paired us up as partners for a book report. Everything was going fine until LeFraud asked me which book we should choose to do our report on and I suggested the Lord of the Rings. Out of nowhere LeCrybaby burst out into TEARS in front of the whole class! The teacher came over to console him and sent me to Principal Adam Silver’s office as punishment. How was I supposed to know that LeMickey was scared of that book because he could never win a real ring himself? 
Went costume shopping for Halloween with my son and I pointed at a Mickey Mouse outfit and I asked him, son would you want this costume? He said "no daddy I don’t want to be LeFraud for Halloween, not at least until he wins a real ring" I shed tears of joy. 
I was at Toys r Us with my 2 year old son shopping for Mickey Mouse toys when suddenly one of them started moving! To my shock it was LeMickey! My son said "dad is it true that LeFraud has no real rings" I said "yes son, and he will never win a real ring". LeBooty ran away crying
RIDICULOUS!     I was watching the Mickey Mouse Ceremony on Disney Channel with my 7 year old son and guess who shows up On the screen?     LeFraud himself!       My son asked me "is that the man who choked 6x in the finals and can’t win a real ring"        I had to lie to my own son. Shame on LeBum

Western European type that combines features of Nordid and Mediterranid in a unique way. Resembles British Iron Age Celts. The principal element in Ireland and parts of Britain, especially Western Scotland and Wales. Common in Northwestern France, sometimes Belgium, Switzerland, Liguria, Western Germany, and Norway. Sporadically from Portugal and Galicia to Austria and Sweden. Not to be confused with British Eurafricanids altered by Nordid admixture. 
The most typical Pamirid variety, also called Mountain Pamirid. Often considered the most typical Turanid. Most common in highland Tajiks, who not only live in Tajikistan, but also Northern Afghanistan and Eastern Uzbekistan. Shows intermediate features between the Plains Pamirid and East Pamirid. It was originally more widespread, and has been pushed back by the Tungid expansion. Sometimes in Uzbeks, Uyghurs, and other Turkic people.

In literature, mythology, and comic books many heros often have a "kryptonite" or "achilles heel", basically a weakness that makes them vulerable. I'm curios what fans here would consider to be Supermans "kryptonite"?

In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, or equivalently, a decrease in the frequency, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency and energy, is known as a blueshift.
